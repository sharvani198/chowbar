Chowbar

This is a React app for the traditional south indian board chowka-bhara (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chowka_bhara). It's similar to Ludo and is usually played with Cowri shells for dice. The Chowka referes to a value of 4 and Bhara is the 8. I am trying to implement the 5x5 board and get a fully funcional 2 or 4 player game. Hope to finish and deploy it soon.
